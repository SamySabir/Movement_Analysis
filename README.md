# Personal_Projects

Hey everyone! You'll see on Probability_calculator.py my very first python project. It is intended to calculate the probability that a deserted robot whose movements are one-dimensional (front, left, right) and random (1, 2, or 3 steps) will arrive at a specific 2D cartesian coordinate.

As for improvements, the math needs to be revised. Some calculations are very complicated. Also, to optimize the code, I would like to implement a user-friendly interface that lets the user choose the final destination and the total amount of steps.
